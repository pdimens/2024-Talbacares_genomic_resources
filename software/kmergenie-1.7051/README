KmerGenie
---------

installation:

    1) Prerequisite: Python >= 2.7, RScript (included in R), a C++ compiler, zlib.
        * If you do not have a recent enough Python or Rscript, a solution is to install Conda: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install then `conda install r-base`
    2) Type `make` in the KmerGenie directory to compile it
    3) Optionnally, to install KmerGenie:
       * (non-root) `python setup.py install --user` will install it as a Python package in your user account
       * (root) `python setup install` will install it as a system Python package
       * (root) `make install` will create a symbolic link of kmergenie to /usr/local/bin (then do not delete the original install folder)

usage:

    ./kmergenie reads_file

reads_file is either a single FASTA, FASTQ, FASTA.gz, FASTQ.gz file or a list of file names, one per line. For example:
    
    ls -1 *.fastq.gz > list_files
    ./kmergenie list_files

    type ./kmergenie to see extra options

input:

    Input reads should be exactly those the de novo assembler will use to create contigs, i.e. the list of all single and paired-end reads.

    The order does not matter, KmerGenie treats the reads as an unordered set of k-mers. Orientation of the reads also does not matter.
    With Velvet, if you have mate-pairs, Velvet uses them to create contigs, so do include them in KmerGenie.
    Otherwise, if the mate-pairs are used only for scaffolding (i.e. asm_flag=2 in SOAPdenovo), do not include them.

tips:

    * Take a look at the generated HTML report. It provides a summary of the results, and contains an Advanced Help section to help analysis.

    * There is no need to use Kmergenie for a multi-k assembler, like SPAdes. Default parameters of multi-k assemblers are generally better than a single best k.

    * By default, KmerGenie will perform another pass to estimate k more precisely. You may skip it by using the "--one-pass" option (roughly 2x faster).

    * To run multiple instances of KmerGenie on the same folder, specify the "-o" and "-t" parameters (output prefix, number of threads per instance).

    * The sampling value e ("-e" parameter) makes sure that roughly n/e k-mers are sampled out of the n distinct kmers in the dataset. The datasets are fully analyzed, though. Kmergenie samples from the set of distinct kmers, not from the set of reads.

    * The diploid model should only be used for moderate-high heterozygosity rates. The haploid model works better when only one peak is visible in the histograms (indicating low heterozygosity).

outputs:

    histograms_report.html
        html report of all the results
    histograms.dat
        file containing the raw data for the number of genomic kmers for each k value
    histograms-k*.histo
        files containing raw sampled histograms for each k value
    histograms-k*.histo.pdf
        plots of the histograms and the fits. Colors: red is the fit of the complete statistical model of the histogram (erroneous k-mers + genomic k-mers). With the diploid model, green are only the heterozygous k-mers, blue are only the homozygous k-mers.
    <stdout>
        last line is the best k value
    <return code / error code>
        0 if and only if a best k was found (note: no longer returns the best k as error code)
